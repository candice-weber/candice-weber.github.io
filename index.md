I am a graduate student in the [VCU School of Life Sciences and Sustainability](https://slss.vcu.edu/), where I’m focused on bringing my data management, project administration, and leadership experience to the fields of environmental conservation and research.

I am also a research administration professional with over 15 years of experience applying for and managing grant-funded research from a variety of federal, foundation, industry and other sponsors.  In addition to my grants background, I have several years of experience in reporting and data analytics supporting strategic decision-making and program evaluation for an academic medical center research office.



## **Recent Projects**

[(Shiny app) Curricular Linguistic Networks of Virginia Environmental Undergraduate Programs](https://candice-weber.shinyapps.io/envs_network/) An interactive application published in December 2025 for visualization of the network topology of Virginia undergraduate environmental degree programs. Allows the user to modify the stringency of covariance among the degree programs and see how the underlying connectivity changes as it is made either more lax or more stringent.

[Linguistic Covariance and Network Structure in Virginia Environmental Undergraduate Degree Programs](https://github.com/candice-weber/va_ess_programs) A text analysis project completed as part of my graduate studies with Dr. Rodney Dyer between August and December 2025.  The goal of this project was to linguistically map Virginia undergraduate environmental degree programs by using R to parse and pre-process the programs' course description texts via a weighted frequency analysis and then mapping the relationships between degree programs based on shared linguistic structures of the required courses.

[Wildfire & High-Elevation Streams: Uncovering short-term hidden impacts on stream-riparian food webs](https://qubeshub.org/publications/5366/1) A lesson on stastistical significance versus ecological relevance, linear mixed-effect models, and the impacts of wildfire on stream-riparian food webs completed for ENVS 603 Environmental Research Methods in May 2025.

[Foraging Behaviors of Enhydra lutris](http://candice-weber.github.io/C.-Weber-Final-Project.html) A data wrangling and anlaysis project completed for ENVS 343 Environmental Data Literacy in April 2024.
